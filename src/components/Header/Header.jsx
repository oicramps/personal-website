      <Description>
        Since I realize the impact software has on people&apos;s lives and how much it can significantly improve it, I
        started giving my best to this career with all my passion. I am a frontend engineer who focuses on producing
        high-quality and well-tested code, mainly using Javascript and its variety of libraries, such as React, NodeJS,
        and Typescript. Through these technologies, I have been focusing on creating reliable and easy-to-use WEB
        applications with consistent UI. I am a team player always in a good mood and resilient to changes with
        leadership and ownership instincts.
