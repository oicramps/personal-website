      <Description>
        Since when I realized the impact that software has on people&apos;s lives and how much it is able to
        significantly improve their lives, I started to give my best and at the same time love this career. I am a
        frontend engineer who focuses on producing quality and well-tested code, mainly using Javascript and its variety
        of libraries, where my repertoire is mainly composed of React, NodeJS, and Typescript. With these technologies,
        I have been focusing on creating WEB applications with a consistent UI, easy to use and that give users
        confidence. I am a person who plays with the team, with leadership and ownership instincts, but always in a good
        mood and adaptable in relation to changes.
